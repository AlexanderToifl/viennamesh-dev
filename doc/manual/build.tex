\section{Building}

In general, ViennaMesh only supports Unix based systems and requires 
several libraries to be available:

\begin{itemize}
   \item CMake~\cite{cmake}
   \item Boost~\cite{boost}
   \item GMP~\cite{gmp}
   \item CGAL~\cite{cgal}
\end{itemize}

Typically \texttt{CMake}, \texttt{CGAL}, and \texttt{GMP} are provided by 
the distributions, for example, Ubuntu. However, CGAL maybe has to be installed manually.

An exemplary build script is provided within the root folder of ViennaMesh. 
\begin{exaipd}
\begin{Verbatim}
build.sh
\end{Verbatim}
\end{exaipd}

Note that \texttt{Debug} and \texttt{Release} builds are available, by utilizing 
the appropriate \texttt{CMake} configuration parameter.
\begin{exaipd}
\begin{Verbatim}
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
\end{Verbatim}
\end{exaipd}

The \texttt{CGAL} include and library paths have to be provided via the 
respective \texttt{CMake} configuration parameters.
\begin{exaipd}
\begin{Verbatim}
-D CGAL_INC_DIR=$CGALINC
-D CGAL_LIB_DIR=$CGALLIB
\end{Verbatim}
\end{exaipd}

Note that the build script expects the parameters \texttt{CGALINC} and 
\texttt{CGALLIB} to be provided by the environment. 
Certainly these paths can be entered statically within the build script.

After the build process is finished, an application executable is available 
within the build folder. 
\begin{exaipd}
\begin{Verbatim}
build/vmesh
\end{Verbatim}
\end{exaipd}

This executable is capable of producing volume meshes of high quality of 
\texttt{bnd} and \texttt{hin} input files. 

\TIP{Example input files can be found in the input/ folder.}
